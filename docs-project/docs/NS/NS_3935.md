# NS 3935 - Requirements for Energy Performance in Buildings

## Introduction
NS 3935 outlines the requirements for energy performance in buildings, focusing on energy efficiency, sustainability, and compliance with national regulations. This standard is essential for ensuring that buildings are designed and constructed to minimize energy consumption and environmental impact.

## Key Requirements
1. **Energy Performance Indicators**: Establishes metrics for assessing the energy performance of buildings, including energy consumption per square meter and overall energy efficiency ratings.

2. **Building Envelope**: Specifies requirements for insulation, air tightness, and thermal bridging to enhance the energy efficiency of the building envelope.

3. **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**: Guidelines for the design and installation of HVAC systems to ensure optimal energy use and indoor climate control.

4. **Renewable Energy Sources**: Encourages the integration of renewable energy technologies, such as solar panels and geothermal systems, to reduce reliance on non-renewable energy sources.

5. **Energy Management Systems**: Recommendations for implementing energy management systems to monitor and optimize energy use throughout the building's lifecycle.

## Compliance and Verification
- **Documentation**: Requires comprehensive documentation of energy performance calculations and compliance with the standard.
- **Testing and Commissioning**: Outlines procedures for testing and commissioning building systems to verify compliance with energy performance requirements.

## Conclusion
Adhering to NS 3935 is crucial for architects, engineers, and builders to ensure that new constructions meet energy performance standards, contributing to a more sustainable built environment.
